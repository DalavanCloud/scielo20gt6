### Abstract

Knowledge from data science or contemporary statistics
can be used to perform analyses and inferences on large datasets
including hundreds of thousands of entries.
The exploratory data analysis of a dataset
in a research aiming to get information from it
might include steps like
  data acquiring,
  cleaning,
  normalization,
  interpretation,
  grouping,
  description and
  visualization.
The goal of this work is
to share techniques, methodologies and tools
for accessing and exploring data from the SciELO database
through its own open access interfaces like
  SciELO Analytics' reports,
  SciELO Ratchet,
  and SciELO ArticleMeta (JSON API and Python software package),
as well as from $4$ external sources:
  Web of Science (SciELO Citation Index),
  Dimensions,
  SCImagoJR and
  Scopus.
Using either Python (IPython/Jupyter, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib,
                     Seaborn, Scipy, NetworkX)
or R (R Studio, dplyr)
as the programming languages,
several analyses had been performed
with their open source code included,
aiming the reproducibility of the results.
